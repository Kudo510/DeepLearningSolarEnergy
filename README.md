# DeepLearningSolarEnergy
This project is the final test for my paper "Deep Learning for Detecting Tilt Angle and Orientation of Photovoltaic Panels on Satellite Imagery" published in 42nd SGAI International Conference on Artificial Intelligence, AI 2022, Cambridge, UK, December 13–15, 2022. <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-21441-7_18"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/PDF-Link-greenlight"/></a>

## Dataset and Labeling

Since it was difficult to find a suitable rooftop dataset, we had to create our own, which, although not large, was proven to be sufficient to confirm the capabilities of our method. 
our data set consists of 430 images generated through Google Maps from 6 different cites in 5 countries in Europe: Oldenburg (Germany), Wilhelmshaven (Germany), Liverpool (England), Bordeaux (France), Milan (Italy), and Vigo (Spain). These images
are captured from a height of around 10 m above ground level. We also used the free open-source tool “LabelImg”to accelerate the labeling of images. The dataset and labeled images look like below:
